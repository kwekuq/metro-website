<h1>Layout</h1>
Even if you just place images and blocks of text randomly on a page, people looking at it will see them as being visually related to each other, simply because they are all presented within the space of their browser window.

<h2>Layout Grids</h2>
<p>Graphic desiners frequently use a layout grid to help organise the elements of a page in a way which is visually structured and coherent, and this device is also of value in Web design, even though web pages have no fixed dimensions. A layout grid is a geometrical division of the page that can be used to control the placement of text blocks and images.</p>
<p>Although alignment is of great importance in creating visual coherence, the grid's additional function of defining regions is what makes it such a powerful tool for visual organization. As long as the same grid is used throughout a Web site's design, different combinations of images and text blocks can be used on different pagesm while preserving a felling of uniformity throughout. Users will recognise the same overall pattern and groupings, even though the elements change, and this helps give the site a particular identity. It also makes it easier to use, as we remember where particular types of elements were placed on previous pages and look for them in the same place again.</p>
<p>Simple grids divide the page into areas, such as text blocks and margins. More complex grids define a framework, into which different-sized blocks can be placed. (See pages 564 and 565 of the prescribed textbook)</p>
<p>Grids aren't an end in themselves, they are just a means of creating alignment and grouping, and enforcing uniformity. If you abondon rigid geometrical contraints, it is possible to employ a modified type of grid that accomodates the dynamic dimensions of Web pages, while maintaining a framework for vertical and horizontal alignments. This leads to flexible layouts.</p>

<div id="FlexLayout">
<h2>Flexible layouts</h2>
<p>A flexible layout abandons the idea of the elements on a page having fixed width and height in favur of allowing them to change their dimensions to accomodate changes in the browser window and font.</p>
<p>The way in which elements behave when either of these changes occur depends on the units that have been used to specify their size.</p>
<p>The case of percentage units perhaps require a little explanation. when a width or height is specified as a percentage, it is interpreted as a percentage of the corresponding dimension of the containing box.</p>
<p>People find it hard tio read text that is laid out in very long lines. There is no agreement on a precise definition of what constitutes en excessively long line. The size at which a line becmes too long to be read confortably can depend on the font family, type size, leading and margins, as well as on the user.A broad consensus is that any value between 40 and 60 characters is likely to work, depending on the associated factors mentioned before.</p>
<p>In CSS there is no unit that allows you to express a length in characters, but em is fairly closely related in most fonts. 1em is usually between 1.5 and 2 characters. Therefor a line length of 30em should give you the required 40 - 60 characters an any conventional font. Column width can also be  expressed as a percentage.</p>
